        <h2>Step 1: Document the Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Before you begin the complaint process, gather as much evidence as
          possible. This might include screenshots, text messages, emails, or
          any other forms of communication that demonstrate the cyberbullying.
          Ensure you have a clear record of the harassment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 2: Find the Appropriate Cybercrime Website</h2>
        <p>
          Identify the official cybercrime reporting website or agency in your
          country. It could be a government agency or a non-profit organization
          dedicated to handling cybercrimes. Search online or contact your local
          law enforcement agency for guidance on where to file your complaint.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 3: Visit the Website</h2>
        <p>
          Go to the official website designated for reporting cybercrimes. The
          URL and interface may vary depending on your location, so ensure
          you're on the correct website.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 4: Navigate to the Reporting Section</h2>
        <p>
          Explore the website to locate the section or page specifically for
          reporting cyberbullying or online harassment. This section might be
          labeled "Report Cyberbullying," "File a Complaint," or something
          similar.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 5: Read the Guidelines and Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Carefully read the guidelines and requirements for filing a cyberbullying
          complaint. Different websites may have different rules and documentation
          requirements. Ensure you have all the necessary information and evidence ready.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 6: Complete the Complaint Form</h2>
        <p>
          Fill out the complaint form provided on the website. This form will
          typically ask for details about the incident, including the date, time,
          location, and a description of the cyberbullying. Be as thorough and accurate
          as possible when providing this information.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 7: Upload Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Attach the evidence you gathered in step 1. This can include screenshots,
          messages, or any other relevant files that support your complaint. Ensure
          the files are appropriately labeled and organized.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 8: Provide Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          You may need to provide your personal information, such as your name,
          contact details, and, in some cases, your identity card or other identifying
          information. This is to help the authorities contact you and investigate the
          matter further.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 9: Review and Submit</h2>
        <p>
          Double-check all the information you've provided on the complaint form.
          Make sure it's accurate and complete. Once you're satisfied, submit the complaint.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 10: Record Your Reference Number</h2>
        <p>
          After submitting the complaint, you should receive a reference number or
          confirmation of submission. Keep this number safe, as it will be essential
          for tracking the progress of your complaint.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 11: Follow Up</h2>
        <p>
          Keep an eye on your email or the website for updates on your complaint.
          Authorities may need to contact you for additional information or updates
          on the investigation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h2>Step 12: Cooperate with Authorities</h2>
        <p>
          If law enforcement or cybercrime investigators reach out to you for further
          information or assistance, be cooperative and provide the necessary support
          to help them resolve the issue.
