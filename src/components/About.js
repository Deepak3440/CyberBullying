       <h2>Power and Control:</h2>
       <p>Cyberbullies use hurtful comments and harassment to exert power and control over their victims. They derive satisfaction from knowing they can affect someone's emotions and self-esteem negatively.</p>
     </div>

     <div>
       <h2>Anonymity:</h2>
       <p>The internet's anonymity enables cyberbullies to conceal their true identity.<br />
         This anonymity emboldens individuals to engage in harmful behavior without immediate consequences, saying things they wouldn't say in person.</p>
     </div>

     <div>
       <h2>Insecurity or Low Self-Esteem:</h2>
       <p>Some cyberbullies have their insecurities or low self-esteem, projecting these feelings onto others.<br />
         They attempt to bring others down, seeking a misguided sense of validation through bullying.</p>
     </div>

     <div>
       <h2>Prevention and Support:</h2>
       <p>Combatting cyberbullying involves promoting digital ethics and responsible online behavior.<br />
         Encourage open communication about online experiences to identify and address issues promptly.<br />
         Provide support for those affected by cyberbullying, including counseling and reporting mechanisms.</p>
