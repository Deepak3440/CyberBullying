          NumPy is a popular Python library for numerical and scientific
          computing. It provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a
          wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Here
          are some key points about NumPy in Python

            <p>
              <b>Arrays:</b> NumPy's primary object is the ndarray, which is a
              multi-dimensional array that can store elements of the same data
              type. NumPy arrays are more efficient and convenient than Python
              lists for numerical operations.

          Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on the Bayes' theorem and the assumption that the features are conditionally independent, given the class labels. It's a variant of the Naive Bayes algorithm, specifically designed for data with continuous or numerical features that follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. GaussianNB is commonly used for classification tasks and is particularly effective when dealing with high-dimensional data. Here are some key aspects of Gaussian Naive Bayes:
